;		    2ND KEYBOARD USING INTERCEPTION AND INTERCEPT.exe (Logitech K120)

; Please watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3e_ri-vOIo for a comprehensive tutorial.

; DANGER: Installing interception may cause your USB devices to stop working sometimes, because it is limited to supporting only 10 of each device class. You have to uninstall it to fix that. Here is a follow up video with new information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn18vv--sFY

; For this reason, I now use the Hasu USB to USB keyboard converter. It's sweet.

;; You should DEFINITELY not be trying to add a 2nd keyboard unless you're already
;; familiar with how AutoHotkey works. I recommend that you at least take this tutorial:
;; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm

;; You should probably use something better than Notepad for your scripting. (Do NOT use Word.)
;; I use Notepad++. "Real" programmers recoil from it, but it's fine for my purposes.
;; https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
;; You'll probably want the syntax highlighting:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45466733/autohotkey-syntax-highlighting-in-notepad


;;;WARNING - THIS IS KINDA UNTESTED SINCE I STOPPED USING IT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES, BY LEAVING A GITHUB... ISSUE.  https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/issues

;;===================== MODIFIERS =========================;;

;;Keep these commented out, as they are!
;Lshift::tooltip, do not use
;Lctrl::tooltip, do not use
;Lwin::tooltip, do not use
;Lalt::tooltip, do not use

;Ralt::tooltip, do not use
;Rwin::tooltip, do not use
;appskey::tooltip, This is not a modifier, but I replaced it with INTERNATIONAL4 (SC079) anyway, because it was able to misbehave.
;Rctrl::tooltip, do not use
;Rshift::tooltip, do not use


;;If you leave the modifier keys alone, it allows for lines like the ones below:
;+z::tooltip, you pressed SHIFT Z on the F23 keyboard.
;^z::tooltip, you pressed CTRL Z on the F23 keyboard.
;!z::tooltip, you pressed ALT Z on the F23 keyboard. I don't recommend this... ALT is dangerous because of menu acceleration, even if you try to disable it like I have
;^!z::tooltip, you pressed CTRL SHIFT Z on the F23 keyboard.
;;Etc.
;;However, I use few to no modifiers on my secondary keyboards... I prefer tap dance instead. The decision is up to you.


;;================= MODIFIERS REMAPPED ======================;;

;; When you replace these with your own functions, I recommend that you do NOT delete the tooltips. Just comment them out. That way, you always know what was changed to what. It gets very confusing very quickly otherwise.
;; Here is the full list of scan code substitutions that I made:
;; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSj0gKDxyWAecB3SIyEZ2ssPETZkkxn67gdIwL1zFUs/edit#gid=824607963

SC070::tooltip, [F23] Lshift -to-> SC070-International 2
SC071::tooltip, [F23] LCtrl -to-> SC071-Language 2
SC072::tooltip, [F23] LWin -to-> SC072-Language 1
SC073::tooltip, [F23] LAlt -to-> SC073-International 1

SC077::tooltip, [F23] RAlt -to-> SC077-Language 4
SC078::tooltip, [F23] RWin -to-> SC078-Language 3
SC079::tooltip, [F23] AppsKey -to-> SC079-International 4
SC07B::tooltip, [F23] RCtrl -to-> SC07B-International 5
SC07D::tooltip, [F23] RShift -to-> SC07D-International 3

;;================= LOCKING KEYS ======================;;

F20::tooltip, [F23] CapsLock -to-> SC06B-F20
SC05C::tooltip, [F23] NumLock -to-> SC05C-International 6
;Numlock is an AWFUL key. I prefer to leave it permanently on.
;It's been changed to International 6, so you can use it with no fear that it'll mess up your numpad.
SC061::tooltip, [F23] ScrollLock -to-> SC061 %A_thishotKey%

;;================= NEXT SECTION ======================;;

PrintScreen::tooltip, [F23] %A_thishotKey%
;;ScrollLock::do not use
SC07E::tooltip, [F23] Pause -to-> SC07E-Brazillian comma

;;Don't use the 3 keys below for your 2nd keyboard!
;Pause::msgbox, The Pause/Break key is a huge PITA. That's why I remapped it to SC07E
;Break::msgbox, Or is it THIS key? WHO KNOWS!
;CtrlBreak::msgbox, I have no idea what Ctrlbreak is. But it shows up sometimes.
;;Don't use the 3 keys above for your 2nd keyboard! Just don't!!

#if ;this line will end the F23 secondary keyboard assignments.

;;;--------------------IMPORTANT: HOW TO USE #IF THINGIES----------------------

;;You can use more than one #if thingy at a time, but it must be done like so:
#if (getKeyState("F23", "P")) and if WinActive("ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe")
F1::msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while inside of Premiere Pro

;; HOWEVER, You still would still need to block F1 using #if (getKeyState("F23", "P"))
;; If you don't, it'll pass through normally, any time Premiere is NOT active.
;; Does that make sense? I sure hope so.

;; Alternatively, you can use the following: (Comment it in, and comment out other instances of F1::)
; #if (getKeyState("F23", "P"))
; F1::
; if WinActive("ahk_exe Adobe Premiere Pro.exe")
; {
	; msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while inside of Premiere Pro
	; msgbox, And you did it by using if WinActive()
; }
; else
	; msgbox, You pressed F1 on your secondary keyboard while NOT inside of Premiere Pro
;;This is easier to understand, but it's not as clean of a solution.

;; #if (getKeyState("F23", "P")) && (uselayer = 0) ;;you can also use a varibable like so, but I don't.
