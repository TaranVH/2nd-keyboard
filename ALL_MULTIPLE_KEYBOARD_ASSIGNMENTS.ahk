; HELLO PEOPLES 
; CHECK OUT MY BIG TUTORIAL FOR SOME EXPLANATION OF HOW THESE
; AHK SCRIPTS WORK, AND HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER.
; https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY?t=20m7s
; ;
; IF YOU HAVE NOT USED AHK BEFORE, YOU MUST TAKE THIS TUTORIAL:
;  https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm
;
; IMPORTANT NOTE:
; Using #include is pretty much the same as pasting an entire script into 
; THIS script. So basically, I'm just importing all the functions that I
; have created in those scripts, so that I can refer to them here.
;
; So, this script has all the keyboard assignments, and the other
; #included scripts have all the functions. I had to split it up this way 
; so that I can also directly launch those functions using means OTHER
; than a keyboard, like the Stream Deck's "open file" feature.
;
; ANOTHER NOTE:
; If you have CUE (Corsair Utility Engine) open, and your keyboard selected 
; (in all its RGB glory,) it will take a lot longer to switch between applications. 
; to fix this lag, simply close CUE, or select some other "demo" peripheral.
;------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
;THIS SCRIPT NO LONGER USES LUAMACROS TO REPROGRAM THE SECOND KEYBOARD. IF YOU WANT THAT CODE, PLEASE GO TO "2nd keyboard if using luamacros.ahk"

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; KEYS                  PREMIERE FUNCTIONS
;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; ctrl alt s            select clip at playhead. Probably this should be moved to a different series of keystrokes, so that "u" is freed for something else.
; backspace             ripple delete --- but I don't use that in AutoHotKey because it's dangerous. This should be changed to something else; I use SHIFT C now.
; shift c               ripple delete --- very convenient for left handed use. Premiere's poor track targeting makes ripple delete less useful than it could be.
; ctrl alt shift d      ripple delete --- I never type this in manually - long shortcuts like this are great for using AHK or a macro to press them.
; delete                delete
; c                     delete --- I also have this on "C" because it puts it directly under my left hand. Very quick.

; shift 1               toggle track targeting for AUDIO LAYER 1

#IfWinActive

;I had the scroll lock key set to shareX's "copy region to clipboard," and used it constantly.
;(printscreen will save region to file as...)
;but the trouble is that the scroll lock state is acctually used by two programs: Excel, and teracopy.
;In excel, having it on will cause the arrow keys to scroll the view, rather than moving from one cell to the other.
;in Teracopy, scroll lock can be used to bypass teracopy and use normal Explorer-based copying, which i prefer for smaller operations.
; Anyway, so that i can actually toggle the scroll lock state, I'm gonna make the scroll lock key send SHIFT PRINTSCREEN, and I'll have SHIFT SCROLL LOCK actually send a normal scroll lock key event. Derpy, but it works for now.

scrolllock::+printscreen ;shareX's "copy region to clipboard." I had it on ALT, but this would open and then close the top menu bar quickly, which is just something I don't wanna have to deal with if it ever goes wrong.

;The following is to remind me to do a thing, when i am rendering anyway.
;CTRL E is my shortcut to Export > Media... , so this will pop up and remind me to make an EDL, which we then submit to APMmusic.ca because they like to know what music tracks we've used in our videos. It's a huge pain, but now that I have the EDL export settings configured just how I like them, (by exporting a mostly empty EDL in my premiere project template, kinda like a dry run,) this whole process only takes me like 2 seconds each time.
; Remember that the ~ character allows the key combo to pass through, so this does NOT block the actual Export Media window from appearing.
;also it's a traytip because a messagebox woudl require me to click on it or press ENTER to dismiss it, which is a pain. Also this makes a noise, which i like.

;UPDATE: So, only Linus Tech Tips, and Tech Linked videos, use APM music. So Tech Quickie, LMG Clips, and other channels, don't use them. So I never need to export EDLs for those videos.
;Therefore, I should not be reminded to export an EDL unless I'm editing an LTT or TL video.
;I've been ignoring the notification because it's usually wrong, because I'm usually editing other channels these days.
;Therefore, it is less effective.
;It's far, far better for me to have ONLY relevant notifications coming to me. I turn off everything else. You would not believe how many apps try to send you notifications.
;Anyway, this is an easy fix. I can just look at the premiere title name, since it has the server address, which never changes.
