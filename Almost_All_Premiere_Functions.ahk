; HELLO PEOPLES!
; IF YOU ARE NEW TO AUTOHOTKEY, YOU MUST AT LEAST TAKE THE FOLLOWING TUTORIAL:
; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm
;
; You will need to know some basic scripting to custom tailor most
; of these scripts to your own machine, if you want to use them!
;
; CHECK OUT MY BIG TUTORIAL FOR SOME EXPLANATION OF HOW THESE
; AHK SCRIPTS WORK, AND HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER.
; https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY?t=20m7s
;
; VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
; This file works in tandem with ALL_MULTIPLE_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk.
; That script has this one 
; All the functions from HERE are actually CALLED from keyboard shortcuts
; in THAT script. I had to do it this way because of the Stream Deck(s)...
; But you can put your key bindings and functions in the same script if
; you want.
;
; You also need to read from around line 90 of ALL_MULTIPLE_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk.
; to see which keybaord shortcut assignements are necessary to make these scripts work.
;
; I recommend that you only copy the functions that you need.
; Add one at a time or it will be overwhelming!
;
; All the code in my github repo is free for you to use and change as you please.
; Just don't try to sell it, and we cool.
;------------------------------------------------------------------------

{
;******FUNCTION FOR DIRECTLY APPLYING A PRESET EFFECT TO A CLIP!******
; preset() is my most used, and most useful AHK function for Premiere Pro!

;===================================================================================
; NEW TO AHK? READ ALL THE BELOW INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU TRY TO USE THIS.
; THIS WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU DO SOME SETUP FIRST!
; Fortunately,
; THERE IS A FULL VIDEO TUTORIAL THAT TEACHES YOU HOW TO USE THIS, STEP BY STEP.
; [[[[[LINK TBD, IT'S NOT FINISHED JUST YET.]]]]]
;
; Even if Adobe does one day add this feature to Premiere, this video tutorial will
; still be very useful to anyone who is learning how to use AHK with Premiere,
; especially if you're trying to use any of the other functions that I've created.
; 
; To call the function, use something like
; F4::preset("crop 50")
; Where "crop 50" is the exact, unique name of the preset you wish to apply.
; 
; For this function to work, you MUST go into Premiere's Keyboard Shortcuts panel,
; find the following commands, and add these keyboard shortcut assignments to them:
; 
; Select Find Box ------- CTRL B
; Shuttle Stop ---------- CTRL ALT SHIFT K
; Window > Effects  ----- CTRL ALT SHIFT 7
;
; (You can use different shortcuts if you like, as long
; as those are the ones you send with your AHK script.)
; 
;====================================================================================

;Keep in mind, I use 100% UI scaling on my primary monitor, so if you use 125% or 150% or anything else, your pixel distances for commands like Mousemove WILL be different. Therefore, you'll need to "comment in" the message boxes, change some numbers, and keep saving and refreshing and retrying the script until you've got it working!
;To find out what UI scaling your screen uses, hit the windows key, type in "display," hit Enter, and then scroll down to "Scale and layout." Under "Change the size of text, apps, and other items," there will be a selection menu thing. Mine is set to "100%." I have NOT done anything in the "Advanced scaling settings" blue link just below that.

;To use this script yourself, carefully go through  testing the script and changing the values, ensuring that the script works, one line at a time. use message boxes to check on variables and see where the cursor is. remove those message boxes later when you have it all working!

;NOTE: I built this under the assumption that your Effects Panel will be on the same monitor as your timeline. I can't guarantee that it'll work if the Effects Panel is on another monitor.

;NOTE: You also need to get the PrFocus() function.

;NOTE: To use the preset() function, your cursor must first be hovering over the clip that you wish to apply your preset to. It also works to select multiple clips, again, as long as your cursor is hovering over one of the selected clips.


keywait, %A_PriorHotKey% ;keywait is quite important.
;Let's pretend that you called this function using the following line:
;F4::preset("crop 50")
;In that case, F4 is the prior hotkey, and the script will WAIT until F4 has been physically RELEASED (up) before it will continue. 
;https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/KeyWait.htm
;Using keywait is probably WAY cleaner than allowing the physical key UP event to just happen WHENEVER during the following function, which can disrupt commands like sendinput, and cause cross-talk with modifier keys.


;;---------You do not need the stuff BELOW this line.--------------

sendinput, {blind}{SC0EC} ;for debugging. YOU DO NOT NEED THIS.
;Keyshower(item,"preset") ;YOU DO NOT NEED THIS. -- it simply displays keystrokes on the screen for the sake of tutorials...

	; Func := Func("Keyshower")
	; RetVal := Func.Call(item,"preset") 
	; }

	{
	goto theEnding ;and this line is here just in case the function is called while not inside premiere. In my case, this is because of my secondary keyboards, which aren't usually using #ifwinactive in addition to #if getKeyState(whatever). Don't worry about it.

;READ ALL THE COMMENTS BELOW OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

;PrFocus() allows you to have ONE place where you define your personal shortcuts to "focus" panels in Premiere. It also ensures that panels actually get into focus, and don't rotate through the sequences or anything like that.

; THERE IS A FULL VIDEO TUTORIAL THAT TEACHES YOU HOW TO USE THIS, STEP BY STEP.
; [[[[[LINK TBD, IT'S NOT FINISHED JUST YET.]]]]]

;For this function to work, you MUST Go to Premiere's Keyboard Shortcuts panel, and add the following keyboard shortcuts to the following commands:

; KEYBOARD SHORTCUT     PREMIERE COMMAND
; ctrl alt shift 3 .....Application > Window > Timeline (The default is shift 3)
; ctrl alt shift 1 .....Application > Window > Project  (Sets the focus onto a BIN.) (the default is SHIFT 1)
; ctrl alt shift 4 .....Application > Window > Program Monitor (Default is SHIFT 4)
; ctrl alt shift 5 .....Application > Window > Effect Controls (Default is SHIFT 5)
; ctrl alt shift 7 .....Application > Window > Effects  (NOT the Effect Controls panel!) (Default is SHIFT 7)

;(Note that ALL_MULTIPLE_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk has the FULL list of keyboard shortcuts that you need to assign in order for my other functions to work.)


;EXPLANATION: In Premiere, panel focus is very important. Many shortucts will only work if a specific panel is in focus. That is why those panels must be put into focus FIRST, which is what I built PrFocus() to do. (It's not always as simple as sending just the one keyboard shortcut to activate that panel.)

;Right now, we do NOT know which panel is in focus, (or "active.") and AHK has no way to tell (that I know of.)
;If a panel is ALREADY in focus, and you send the shortcut to bring it into focus again, that panel might then switch to a different sequence in the case of the timeline or program monitor,, or a different item in the case of the Source panel. IT's a nightmare!

;Therefore, we must start with a clean slate. For that, I chose the EFFECTS panel. Sending its focus shortcut multiple times, has no ill effects.

Sendinput, ^!+7 ;bring focus to the effects panel... OR, if any panel had been maximized (using the `~ key by default) this will unmaximize that panel, but sadly, that panel will still be the one in focus.
;Note that if the effects panel is ALREADY maximized, then sending the shortcut to switch to it will NOT un-maximize it. This is OK, though, because I never maximize the Effects Panel. If you do, then you might want to switch to the Effect Controls panel first, and THEN the Effects panel after this line.
;note that sometimes I use ^+! instead... it makes no difference compared to ^!+

sleep 12 ;waiting for Premiere to actaully do the above.

Sendinput, ^!+7 ;Bring focus to the effects panel AGAIN. Just in case some panel somewhere was maximized, THIS will now guarantee that the Effects panel is ACTAULLY in focus.

sleep 5 ;waiting for Premiere to actaully do the above.

sendinput, {blind}{SC0EC} ;scan code of an unassigned key. Used for debugging. You do not need this.

if (panel = "effects")
	goto theEnd ;do nothing. The shortcut has already been sent.
else if (panel = "timeline")
	Sendinput, ^!+3 ;if focus had already been on the timeline, this would have switched to the "next" sequence (in some unpredictable order.)
else if (panel = "program") ;program monitor. If focus had already been here, this would have switched to the "next" sequence.

	Sendinput, ^!+2

;NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE YOUR WINDOWS CLEARTYPE SETTINGS, OR THE TEXT WILL BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, AND IMAGESEARCH WILL NO LONGER WORK!

;UPDATE:
;I had overwritten the high DPI scaling behaviour of Premiere, by following THESE instructions: https://forums.adobe.com/message/10081059#10081059 , which changes the look of text and other elements of Premiere.
;Doing this totally BROKE the functionality of instantVFX() because now the pixel colors were different, and the images to be searched for would have had to have been updated.
;THEREFORE, I switched back to Premiere's built-in UI scaling, and will just have to wait for adobe to fix the issues that come with it.
;UPDATE 2: now that i have a 43" 4k monitor, I am back to 100% UI and it is wonderful. Will NEVER go back. 150% UI is just such a PITA to deal with.
