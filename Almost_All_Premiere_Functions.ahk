; HELLO PEOPLES!
; IF YOU ARE NEW TO AUTOHOTKEY, YOU MUST AT LEAST TAKE THE FOLLOWING TUTORIAL:
; https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm
;
; You will need to know some basic scripting to custom tailor most
; of these scripts to your own machine, if you want to use them!
;
; CHECK OUT MY BIG TUTORIAL FOR SOME EXPLANATION OF HOW THESE
; AHK SCRIPTS WORK, AND HOW THEY COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER.
; https://youtu.be/O6ERELse_QY?t=20m7s
;
; VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
; This file works in tandem with ALL_MULTIPLE_KEYBOARD_ASSIGNMENTS.ahk.
; All the functions from HERE are actually CALLED from keyboard shortcuts
; in THAT script. I had to do it this way because of the Stream Deck(s)...
; But you can put your key bindings and functions in the same script if
; you want.
;
; I reccomend that you only copy the functions that you need.
; Add one at a time or it will be overwhelming!
;
; All the code in my github repo is free for you to use and change as you please.
; Just don't try to sell it, and we cool.
;------------------------------------------------------------------------


;the variable below POSSIBLY exists for the purpose of communicaiton with gui.ahk if a script is launched from the Stream Deck.
TargetScriptTitle = "C:\AHK\2nd-keyboard\gui.ahk ahk_class AutoHotkey"
;but apparently I do not know for sure...

recallTransition(foo) ;this was a part of the luamacros scripts.
{
;Do nothing.
msgbox, the recallTransition function was deleted cause it never worked very well.
}

;;;;;;non luamacros stuff begins now.;;;;;

;how to use instantVFX: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi3zBqO74ms

;UPDATE:
;I overwrote the high DPI scaling behaviour of Premiere, by following THESE instructions: https://forums.adobe.com/message/10081059#10081059 , which changes the look of text and other elements of Premiere.
;Doing this totally BROKE the functionality of instantVFX() because now the pixel colors were different, and the images to be searched for would have had to have been updated.
;THEREFORE, I switched back to Premiere's built-in UI scaling, and will just have to wait for adobe to fix the issues that come with it.
